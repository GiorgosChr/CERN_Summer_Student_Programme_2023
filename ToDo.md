# ToDo List - CERN Summer Student Programme

## $1^{st}$ Week 12/06 - 16/6
### FirstPlots
- [x] Plot $m(D^0)$
- [x] Plot $m(D^\star)$
- [x] Plot the mass difference of the two
- [x] Plot Transverse momentum of $D^0$ and of the soft $\pi$ and $K$ mesons
- [ ] Histograms with errorbars (sqrt)
- [x] 2D Histogram for $p_x - p_z$

## $2^{nd}$ Week 19/06 - 23/06
### ChargedPi
- [x] Copy TTree to a new file
- [x] Add random charges to soft $\pi$ with uniform distribution\
- [x] Generate data with RapidSim for $D^{\star}\rightarrow \{D^0 \rightarrow \pi^-\pi^+\}\pi$
- [x] Use $25\%$ asymmetry to assign charges to the soft pions. This corresponds to an emulated production asymmetry
- [ ] Remove either positively or negatively charged pions according to a different distribution-asymmetry of $50\%$ that corresponds to the $CP$ asymmetry
