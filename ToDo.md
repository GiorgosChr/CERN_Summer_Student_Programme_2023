# ToDo List - CERN Summer Student Programme

## $1^{st}$ Week 12/06 - 16/6
### FirstPlots
- [x] Plot $m(D^0)$
- [x] Plot $m(D^\star)$
- [x] Plot the mass difference of the two
- [x] Plot Transverse momentum of $D^0$ and of the soft $\pi$ and $K$ mesons
- [ ] Histograms with errorbars (sqrt)
- [x] 2D Histogram for $p_x - p_z$

## $2^{nd}$ Week 19/06 - 23/06
### ChargedPi
- [x] Copy TTree to a new file
- [x] Add random charges to soft $\pi$ with uniform distribution\
- [x] Generate data with RapidSim for $D^{\star}\rightarrow \{D^0 \rightarrow \pi^-\pi^+\}\pi$
- [x] Use $0.25$ as production asymmetry, i.e., production of $D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$, the probability then should be $N_\pm = \frac{1 \pm A}{2}$.
- [x] Save this to a new intermediate TTree in a ROOT file
- [x] Use $0.50$ as $CP$ asymmetry, i.e., asymmetry between $D^0 \to K^- K^+$ and $\bar{D}^0 \to K^- K^+$. This should remove either positively charged or negatively charged $\pi$ events. The probability for the $D^0$ is $\frac{1-A_{CP}}{1 + A_{CP}}$
- [ ] Assign asymmetry to the soft pion
