# Observation of $CP$ violation in charm decays 

## Notes:
### $CP$ asymmetry and $D^0$ mesons:

- Search for $CP$ violation in $D^0 \to K^-K^+$ and $D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$ decays.
- We obtain the $D^0$ mesons through $\bar{B} \to D^0\mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu X$ and $D^\star(2010)^+\to D^0\pi^+$
- The time-dependent asymmetry between $D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$ states decaying to a $CP$ eigenstate $f$ is
$$A_{C P}(f ; t) \equiv \frac{\Gamma\left(D^0(t) \rightarrow f\right)-\Gamma\left(\bar{D}^0(t) \rightarrow f\right)}{\Gamma\left(D^0(t) \rightarrow f\right)+\Gamma\left(\bar{D}^0(t) \rightarrow f\right)}, \;\;f = K^-K^+, \pi^-\pi^+$$ 
- The difference in $CP$ asymmetries for $A_\Gamma$ independent of final state reads
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta A_{C P} & \equiv A_{C P}\left(K^{-} K^{+}\right)-A_{C P}\left(\pi^{-} \pi^{+}\right) \\
& \approx \Delta a_{C P}^{\mathrm{dir}}-\frac{\Delta\langle t\rangle}{\tau\left(D^0\right)} A_{\Gamma}
\end{aligned}$$
- We get the $D^0$ mesons from $D^{\star+}\to D^0(f)\pi^+,\;\; D^{\star-}\to \bar{D}^0(f)\pi^-$ or from $\bar{B}\to D^0\mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu X$. We determine the flavor at production from the charge of the accompanying pion
- We refer to $\mu-$ or $\pi$-tagged $D^0$ decays according to the particle used for identifying the meson
- The raw asymmetries are defined as 
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{\text {raw }}^{\pi \text { tagged }}(f) & \equiv \frac{N\left(D^{*+} \rightarrow D^0(f) \pi^{+}\right)-N\left(D^{*-} \rightarrow \bar{D}^0(f) \pi^{-}\right)}{N\left(D^{*+} \rightarrow D^0(f) \pi^{+}\right)+N\left(D^{*-} \rightarrow \bar{D}^0(f) \pi^{-}\right)}, \\
A_{\text {raw }}^{\mu \text {-tagged }}(f) & \equiv \frac{N\left(\bar{B} \rightarrow D^0(f) \mu^{-} \bar{\nu}_\mu X\right)-N\left(B \rightarrow \bar{D}^0(f) \mu^{+} \nu_\mu X\right)}{N\left(\bar{B} \rightarrow D^0(f) \mu^{-} \bar{\nu}_\mu X\right)+N\left(B \rightarrow \bar{D}^0(f) \mu^{+} \nu_\mu X\right)},
\end{aligned}$$
- The final $CP$ asymmetry is approximately 
$$\Delta A_{CP} = A_\text{raw}(K^-K^+) - A_\text{raw}(\pi^-\pi^+)$$

### Event selection:
#### Software trigger, Stage 1:

- At least one track has large $p_T$ and is incompatible with originating from any primary vertex (PV), or if any two-track combination forming a secondary vertex is found in the event

#### Software tirgger, Stage 2:

- $D^0$ candidates are reconstructed using particle0identification (PID) criteria
- $D^0$ decay vertex must be well separated from all PVs in the event
- More requirements on $D^0$ transverse momentum, the angle between the $D^0$ momentum and its flight direction, PID information and the impact-parameter significances
- For the $\mu-$tagged sample, the $B$ candidates are formed from the combination of a $D^0$ candidate and a muon with the requirement that they originate from a common vertex
- More requirements are employed on the invariant mass $m(D^0\mu)$ and on the corrected mass $m_\text{corr} \equiv \sqrt{m(D^0\mu)^2 + p_\perp(D^0\mu)^2} + p_\perp(D^0\mu)$
