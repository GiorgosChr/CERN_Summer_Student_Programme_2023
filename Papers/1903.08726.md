## Notes:
### $CP$ asymmetry and $D^0$ mesons:

- Search for $CP$ violation in $D^0 \to K^-K^+$ and $D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$ decays.
- We obtain the $D^0$ mesons through $\bar{B} \to D^0\mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu X$ and $D^\star(2010)^+\to D^0\pi^+$
- The time-dependent asymmetry between $D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$ states decaying to a $CP$ eigenstate $f$ is
$$A_{C P}(f ; t) \equiv \frac{\Gamma\left(D^0(t) \rightarrow f\right)-\Gamma\left(\bar{D}^0(t) \rightarrow f\right)}{\Gamma\left(D^0(t) \rightarrow f\right)+\Gamma\left(\bar{D}^0(t) \rightarrow f\right)}, f = K^-K^+, \pi^-\pi^+$$ 
- The difference in $CP$ asymmetries for $A_\Gamma$ independent of final state reads
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta A_{C P} & \equiv A_{C P}\left(K^{-} K^{+}\right)-A_{C P}\left(\pi^{-} \pi^{+}\right) \\
& \approx \Delta a_{C P}^{\mathrm{dir}}-\frac{\Delta\langle t\rangle}{\tau\left(D^0\right)} A_{\Gamma}
\end{aligned}$$
- We get the $D^0$ mesons from $D^{\star+}\to D^0(f)\pi^+, D^{\star-}\to \bar{D}^0(f)\pi^-$ or from $\bar{B}\to D^0\mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu X$. We determine the flavor at production from the charge of the accompanying pion
- We refer to $\mu-$ or $\pi$-tagged $D^0$ decays according to the particle used for identifying the meson
- The raw asymmetries are defined as 

$$\begin{aligned}
A_{\text {raw }}^{\pi \text { tagged }}(f) & \equiv \frac{N\left(D^{*+} \rightarrow D^0(f) \pi^{+}\right)-N\left(D^{*-} \rightarrow \bar{D}^0(f) \pi^{-}\right)}{N\left(D^{*+} \rightarrow D^0(f) \pi^{+}\right)+N\left(D^{*-} \rightarrow \bar{D}^0(f) \pi^{-}\right)}, \\
A_{\text {raw }}^{\mu \text {-tagged }}(f) & \equiv \frac{N\left(\bar{B} \rightarrow D^0(f) \mu^{-} \bar{\nu}_\mu X\right)-N\left(B \rightarrow \bar{D}^0(f) \mu^{+} \nu_\mu X\right)}{N\left(\bar{B} \rightarrow D^0(f) \mu^{-} \bar{\nu}_\mu X\right)+N\left(B \rightarrow \bar{D}^0(f) \mu^{+} \nu_\mu X\right)},
\end{aligned}$$

- The final $CP$ asymmetry is approximately 
$$\Delta A_{CP} = A_\text{raw}(K^-K^+) - A_\text{raw}(\pi^-\pi^+)$$

### Event selection:
#### Software trigger, Stage 1:

- At least one track has large $p_T$ and is incompatible with originating from any primary vertex (PV), or if any two-track combination forming a secondary vertex is found in the event

#### Software tirgger, Stage 2:

- $D^0$ candidates are reconstructed using particle identification (PID) criteria
- $D^0$ decay vertex must be well separated from all PVs in the event
- More requirements on $D^0$ transverse momentum, the angle between the $D^0$ momentum and its flight direction, PID information and the impact-parameter significances
- For the $\mu$-tagged sample, the $B$ candidates are formed from the combination of a $D^0$ candidate and a muon with the requirement that they originate from a common vertex
- More requirements are employed on the invariant mass $m(D^0\mu)$ and on the corrected mass $m_\text{corr} \equiv \sqrt{m(D^0\mu)^2 + p_\perp(D^0\mu)^2} + p_\perp(D^0\mu)$

#### Offline selection trigger:

- Selection requirements take into account whether the decision was taken due to signal decay products or to other particles from the event
- Exclude kinematic regions characterized by large detection asymmetries for $\pi$- and $\mu$-tagging 
- For $\pi$-tagged $D^0$ mesons a requirement is applied on the $D^0 \chi^2_\text{IP}$ (impact-parameter significance) to suppress the background of $D^0$ mesons from $B$ decays
- Tightened PID requirements on the $D^0$ decay products
- Good fit quality requirement for $D^0$ and $\pi$ candidates to form $D^{\star+}$
- The invariant mass of $D^0$ candidates must lie within $\pm 3\sigma$ around the known invariant mass of $D^0$
- The $D^{\star+}$ vertex must coincide with the nearest PV
- For $\mu$-tagged mesons we apply more filters to $B$ candidates using a boosted decision tree (BDT) to suppress the background due to random combinations of particles not originating from a $D^0$ decay
- $D^0$ candidates are vetoed if the invariant mass of $\mu^\mp\pi^\pm(\mu^\mp K^\pm)$ lies within $\pm 50\text{MeV}/\text{c}^2$ around the $J/\psi$ or $\psi(2S)$ masses

### Data analysis:
#### Corrections and weighting:

- Events with multiple $D^{\star+}$ and $B$ candidates
- We select only one candidate randomly
- $10\%$ and $0.4\%$ of events have multiple candidates for $\pi$-tagged and $\mu$-tagged samples
- Small correction to the $K^-K^+$ sample is applied as a weighting procedure
- For $\pi$-tagged sample, the weights are calculated by taking the ratio between the three-dimensional background-subtracted distributions of transverse momentum, azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity of the $D^{\star+}$ in the $K^-K^+$ and $\pi^-\pi^+$ modes
- A similar procedure is applied for $\mu$-tagged samples
- Check posteriori that the distributions of the same variables for different tagging are equalized by the weighting

#### Signal analysis:

- Least-square fit to the binned mass distributions of $D^{\star+}$ and $D^{\star-}$ candidates for the $\pi$-sample
- The fits are performed to the $m(D^0\pi^+)$ and $m(\bar{D}^0\pi^-)$ distributions
- The signal mass model is the sum of three Gaussian functions and a Johnson $S_U$ function with free parameters
- The combinatorial background is described by $\left[m(D^0\pi^+) - m(D^0) - m(\pi^+)\right]^\alpha \exp(\beta m(D^0\pi^+))$
- For the $\mu$-tagged sample the fits are performed to the $m(D^0)$ distributions
- The signal is the sum of two Gaussian functions convolved with a truncated power-law function
- The combinatorial background is described by an exponential function

#### Systematic uncertainties:

- For $\pi$-tagged decays the dominant systematic uncertainty is related to the knowledge of the signal and background models. The uncertainty is calculated by generating pseudoexperiments according to the fit model and then fitting alternative models to the generated data. The assigned systematic uncertainty is $0.6\times 10^{-4}$ according to the largest variation observed using the alternative functions
- For $\mu$-tagged decays a similar study is performed with a result of $2\times 10^{-4}$
- In the case of $\mu$-tagged decays the systematic uncertainty mostly originates from the possibility that the $D^0$ is not tagged correctly
- $0.2\times 10^{-4}$ and $1\times 10^{-4}$ for $\pi$-tagged and $\mu$-tagged respectively due to the knowledge of the weights used in the kinematic weighting procedure
- A small fraction of $D^0$ mesons from $B$ decays appear in the final $\pi$-tagged sample with a corresponding systematic uncertainty of $0.3\times 10^{-4}$
- Systematic uncertainty due to background components peaking in $m(D^0\pi)$ instead of $m(D^0)$ is also determined with a value of $0.5\times 10^{-4}$
- For $b$-hadron production asymmetries the systematic uncertainty is estimated to be $1\times 10^{-4}$
- Due to the difference in $B$ reconstruction efficiency a systematic uncertainty with a value of $2\times 10^{-4}$ occurs
- In total we have $0.9\times 10^{-4}$ and $5\times 10^{-4}$ for $\pi$-tagged and $\mu$-tagged samples respectively

#### Asymmetry calculations:

- The difference of the background raw asymmetries is $\Delta A_\text{bkg} = (-2\pm 4)\times 10^{-4}$
- $\Delta A^{\pi\text{-tagged}}_{CP} = [-18.2\pm 3.2(\text{stat.})\pm 0.9(\text{syst.})]\times 10^{-4}$
- $\Delta A^{\mu\text{-tagged}}_{CP} = [-9\pm 8(\text{stat.})\pm 5(\text{syst.})]\times 10^{-4}$
- Considering previously obtained results from the LHCb, $\Delta A_{CP} = (-15.4\pm 2.9)\times 10^{-4}$ where both statistical and systematic errors are taken into account. This results deviates from zero by $5.3\sigma$
- $\Delta a^\text{dir}_{CP} = (-15.7\pm 2.9)\times 10^{-4}$ which means that $\Delta A_{CP}$ is mostly sensitive to direct $CP$ violation
