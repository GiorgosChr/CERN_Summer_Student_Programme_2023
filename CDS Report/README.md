# CDS Summer Student Programme Report
Submitted on $2^{nd}$ of August 2023 on [CDS](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2866568/)

## Abstract:
We investigate the asymmetries that occur in charm decays at the LHCb, specifically we study $D^{\star+}\to D^0\pi^+$ and $D^{\star-}\to \bar{D}^0\pi^-$ where $D^0\to K^-K^+$ or $D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$.
We study the effect of $CP$ and detection asymmetries on MC samples generated via RapidSim and implement a new kinematic weighting function which allows us to keep events that are otherwise discarded from LHCb data, since they are associated with large detection asymetries.
