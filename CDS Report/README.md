## Abstract:
We investigate the asymmetries that occur in charm decays at the LHCb, specifically we study $D^{\star+}\to D^0\pi^+$ and $\bar{D}^{\star-}\to D^0\pi^-$ where $D^0\to K^-K^+$ or $D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$.
We study the effect of $CP$ and detection asymmetries on MC samples generated via RapidSim and implement a new kinematic weighting function which allows us to keep events that are otherwise discarded from LHCb data, since they are associated with large detection asymetries.
